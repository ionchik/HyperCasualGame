# About
It was small challenge for me... This is a very simple game created by 10 minutes. In this simple game you need to catch balls.
What I managed to do in this short time:
1. Swipe controller
2. Spawner with dynamic time between spawn
3. Trigger handling
4. Current and best score view
5. Best score save

It was cool experience for me ^_^
